# To do list
- Buy the following parts:
    - heat shrink
    - multiple usb ports
- create aruco supports attached to end effector and pool table
- incorporate camera calibration to src
- add more images to dataset roboflow and label them
- make sure invalid positions after homing are not considered:
    - for example, after homing, top left corner is set to 0,0 so positions like -100,-100 are not valid
- add an arduino function to know what are the maximum positions the motor can go without touching the switches
- add a calibration proceddure to know the rellationship between pixels and steps
