# To do list



## Hardware

- [ ] Document
  - [ ] ball sizes + weight
  - [ ] measures of the pool table
  - [ ] Document the behaviour of the H configuration (the drawing of the directions motors needs to scroll to advance or not the carriage)
- [ ] Buy/get
  - [ ] Logic mosfet
  - [ ] Beefy solenoid pls
  - [ ] Mini step motor?
  - [ ] MultiUSB port adaptor
- [ ] Actuator 0
  - [ ] First CAD design
- [ ] Actuator 1 (spring loded)
  - [ ] First CAD design



## Software

- [ ] Fix: Possible issue with `C:\Github\pool-playing-robot` when calling `save_folder = "data/photos/",` if CWD is different
- [ ] Add UX to camera when being used from main.py
- [ ] Check if camera can be kept alive from the software side
- [ ] Add UX to arduinos (auto detect them and ping)
- [ ] Update main to get correct corners etc
- [ ] FOV deformation
  - [x] First implementation
  - [ ] Execute the implementation
  - [ ] Check the roundness of the balls and the distance in between the centroids
- [ ] Ball detection
  - [ ] First YOLO detection
  - [ ] Test first YOLO detection
  - [ ] Add UX to YOLO (if file missing or other stuff)
- [ ] Code main controller
  - [ ] Make a first iteration
- [ ] Physics simulation
  - [ ] Make first proposal
