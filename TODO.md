# To do list
- Buy the following parts:
    - heat shrink
    - multiple usb ports
- create aruco supports attached to end effector and pool table
- aruco detection is not accurate after camera undistortion
- make a script to compute the repeatability error of aruco detection (take 5 images without moving anything and calculate the coord pixel error)
