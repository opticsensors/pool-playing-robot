- [ ] Buy/get
  - [ ] Logic mosfet
  - [ ] Beefy solenoid pls
  - [ ] Mini step motor?
  - [ ] MultiUSB port adaptor
- [ ] Actuator 0
  - [ ] First CAD design
- [ ] Actuator 1 (spring loded)
  - [ ] First CAD design



## Software

- [ ] Fix: Possible issue with `C:\Github\pool-playing-robot` when calling `save_folder = "data/photos/",` if CWD is different
- [ ] Check if camera can be kept alive from the software side
- [ ] UX
  - [x] Add UX to camera when being used from main.py
  - [x] Add UX to arduinos  detect them
  - [ ] Add UX to arduinos ping them
- [ ] Update main to get correct corners etc
- [ ] FOV deformation
  - [x] First implementation
  - [ ] Execute the implementation
  - [ ] Check the roundness of the balls and the distance in between the centroids
- [ ] Ball detection
  - [ ] First YOLO detection
  - [ ] Test first YOLO detection
  - [ ] Add UX to YOLO (if file missing or other stuff)
- [ ] Code main controller
  - [x] Make a first iteration
  - [ ] Main controller has working loop to control stuff
