# To do list
- Buy the following parts:
    - heat shrink
- create aruco support attached to end effector and pool table
- test camera calibration
- make sure invalid positions after homing are not considered:
    - for example, after homing, top left corner is set to 0,0 so positionslike -100,-100 are not valid
